# LLM-CLI

A simple LLM chat wrapper for those of us who live in the terminal.

## Installation

``` bash
$ npm i -g llm-cli
```

This will add the global `llm` shell command.

## Basic Usage

To get started just use the chat command:

``` bash
$ llm chat
```

When you first use `llm-cli` you will then be prompted to set up your default preset. Presets are just predefined model configurations you can use for convenience. Once your default config is set up you will enter a chat conversation with the model set up in your default preset.

## Other options

Use `llm help` to see all other options.
